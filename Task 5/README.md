ðŸ¦ˆ# Task 5: Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis Task

This repository contains the files and report for a basic network traffic analysis task performed using Wireshark. This task is part of the Cyber Security Internship program by Elevate Labs.

## Task Objective

The primary objective of this task was to:
* Capture live network packets from an active network interface.
* Identify basic network protocols and traffic types within the captured data.
* Utilize Wireshark's filtering capabilities to isolate specific protocols.
* Understand the fundamental roles of these protocols in network communication.

## Tools Used

* **Wireshark:** A free and open-source packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.

## Methodology

1.  **Installation:** Wireshark was installed on the local system.
2.  **Packet Capture:** Wireshark was used to capture network packets on the active network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet) for approximately one minute.
3.  **Traffic Generation:** During the capture, network traffic was generated by:
    * Using the `ping` command to a known server (e.g., `google.com`).
4.  **Analysis:**
    * The captured traffic was then analyzed within Wireshark.
    * Display filters were applied to isolate and examine specific protocols such as DNS, UDP, ARP, TCP, and HTTP.
    * Packet details were inspected to understand the information contained within protocol headers.

## Files in this Repository

* A .pcap extension file is the raw packet capture file containing all the network traffic recorded during the session. It can be opened and analyzed using Wireshark.
* Protocols_Identified report, this document summarizes the protocols identified during the analysis, their descriptions, and observations made from the captured traffic.
* Various screenshots of protocols and networks which we captured.

## Identified Protocols (Summary)

The analysis successfully identified several key networking protocols, including:
* **DNS (Domain Name System):** For resolving domain names to IP addresses, primarily over UDP.
* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** A connectionless transport protocol used by DNS and other services.
* **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** For resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses on the local network.
* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** A connection-oriented transport protocol used for reliable data delivery (e.g., for HTTP).
* **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** An application-layer protocol for web Browse (if unencrypted sites were visited).

## Learning Outcome

This task provided practical experience in:
* Using Wireshark for packet capture and analysis.
* Understanding the flow of network traffic.
* Recognizing common network protocols and their roles.
* Applying filters to investigate specific types of traffic.
* Basic network troubleshooting awareness.
  
## What I Took Away From This

Honestly, this was a great learning experience! It's one thing to read about protocols, but actually *seeing* them in action with Wireshark really makes things click.
* Got much more comfortable using Wireshark.
* It definitely demystified some of the "invisible" stuff happening on my network.
* The filtering feature in Wireshark is super powerful.
* It's clear how crucial this kind of analysis is for troubleshooting and security.

Thanks for checking out my project! Hope it's interesting or maybe even helps someone else who's just starting to explore network analysis.
